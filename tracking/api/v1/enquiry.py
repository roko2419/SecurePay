# Public endpoint (no login) that a customer hits from the signed enquiry
# link (see tracking.signing.build_enquiry_link) to report a delivery
# problem. Feeds adminpanel's Enquiries dashboard on the other end.
#
# REQUEST FORMAT: must be multipart/form-data, not JSON — evidence_file is
# read from request.FILES, which only gets populated for multipart uploads.
# The frontend's api/enquiry.js (securepay-client) builds this with a
# FormData object for exactly this reason.
#
# NOTHING STOPS DUPLICATE SUBMISSIONS FOR THE SAME ORDER: there's no check
# here for "does an EnquiryData row already exist for this order_id" — the
# signed link can be submitted against multiple times (a customer resubmitting
# after being told to add more detail, retrying after what looked like a
# failed submit, etc.), and each submission creates its own separate
# EnquiryData row, all sharing the same order_id. This is why a single order
# can show up with several ENQxx rows in the admin panel's Enquiries list —
# that's expected, not a bug, but worth knowing so you don't assume order_id
# is unique on EnquiryData (it explicitly isn't — only enquiry_id is).
