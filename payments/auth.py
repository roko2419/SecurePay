# Merchant-side authentication.
#
# There are TWO independent ways a request can prove it's from a legitimate
# merchant, and this file implements both:
#
#   A) Session token (the normal path): issued at login by
#      merchant.v1.create_merchant.LoginMerchant, stored in Redis, and sent
#      back on every request as either a bare token or "<merchant_id>-<token>"
#      (see _normalize_session_token). This is what get_merchant_id_from_token()
#      checks, and it's what almost every merchant-authenticated view in this
#      project uses (payments/api/v1/generate_order.py, phonepe.py, etc.).
#
#   B) Signed per-order token (a fallback with no session involved): a
#      caller who was never logged in — think a server-to-server webhook or
#      a hosted-checkout redirect link the merchant generated themselves —
#      can instead prove they're that merchant by presenting
#      sha512(merchant_key + merchant_order_id + merchant_salt). Only
#      verify_merchant_auth_token() checks this path; get_merchant_id_from_token()
#      does NOT, so a caller relying on path B must call
#      verify_merchant_auth_token() directly, not the token-lookup shortcut.
#      merchant_key/merchant_salt are the two secrets generated once at
#      signup (see merchant.v1.create_merchant.CreateMerchant) and never
#      change, which is what makes this usable without any prior session.
#
# This is the merchant equivalent of adminpanel/auth.py, which implements
# the identical Redis-session pattern (path A) for Django's own admin/staff
# users instead of MerchantInfo rows. If you're changing the session TTL or
# storage mechanism, check both files — they're independent copies of the
# same idea, not sharing code.
